# Login and Signup Authentication UI

This project provides a Flutter implementation of a Login and Signup Authentication UI, designed to be integrated into Flutter applications for user authentication.

## Features

- **Login Screen**: Allows existing users to log in to their accounts.
- **Signup Screen**: Enables new users to create an account.
- **Email and Password Authentication**: Validates user credentials through email and password combination.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.

## Getting Started

To integrate this authentication UI into your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.


2. **Copy UI Components**: Copy the relevant UI components (login screen, signup screen) from the cloned repository to your Flutter project's `lib` directory.

3. **Modify UI Components**: Customize the UI components according to your project's design requirements. You may need to adjust colors, fonts, and layouts to match your application's theme.

4. **Integrate Authentication Logic**: Implement the authentication logic to handle user login and signup actions. This typically involves communicating with your backend server to verify user credentials and manage user accounts.

5. **Test the UI**: Test the login and signup screens to ensure that they function correctly and validate user inputs accurately.

6. **Deploy**: Once you're satisfied with the integration and testing, deploy your Flutter application with the Login and Signup Authentication UI to your desired platform (Android, iOS, web).
